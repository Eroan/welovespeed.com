# Health Protocol

The whole **{{ site.title }}** team is proud to welcome you in the best conditions. To face the specific context resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, we have selected contractors with protocols that respect the current governmental guidelines.

_This page reflects the protocol at a certain time. It is likely to be updated until the event occurs to adapt to the health context. A doubt, a question? Do not hesitate to read the detailed protocols of our contractors._

## Protocol in Effect Since August 2023

Restrictions are in force in metropolitan France. While you are in France you will need to present a **Health Path** (_Pass Sanitaire_) for access to certain events and places.
If you have a vaccination certificate issued out of France but not a French Health Pass, please follow the procedure issued by France Diplomacy: "[Applying for a COVID certificate if you were vaccinated abroad (procedure for non-European nationals entering France and non-European students)](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coronavirus-advice-for-foreign-nationals-in-france/coronavirus-statements/article/applying-for-a-covid-certificate-if-you-were-vaccinated-abroad-procedure-for)".

_During your stay in France, download and activate the [#TousAntiCovid](https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/tousanticovid) application._

We ask that you **wear a mask** with a filtration rate of over 90% or a surgical mask when you travel. You can remove it when you enjoy our snacks or meals.

**Hydroalcoholic gel** is available. You must use it when you arrive to wash your hands.

Pre-event registrations will be used to **track** participants in order to inform them of the occurrence of a COVID+ case, if needed.

Information boards are in place, omnipresent and updated to ensure strict compliance with the health best practices (including **social distanciation**) and invite the installation of the "TousAntiCovid" application.
