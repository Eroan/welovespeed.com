## Why Nantes ? <span aria-hidden>ü•ò</span>

- To decentralize the French Web, physically, so that all Web-related events do not take place in Paris. Last year we set camp at Paris, but we've set foot in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon. This year, we wanted to get closer to the west. Who knows where we‚Äôll be next year?
- Nantes has an international aiport, is easy to acesss from nearby country by train at only 2h from Paris.
- People are nice and friendly, and the food is excellent!
