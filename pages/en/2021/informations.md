## Getting there

### By train 🚄

As an example there is a TGV every 30 minutes from Paris to Lyon [TGV Paris-Lyon](https://www.trainline.fr/search/paris/lyon/2021-12-16-06:00/2021-12-16-18:00) and price is 60 € and 90 €.

There is 2 rail stations in Lyon : "Part Dieu" and "Perrache". They are equivalent except for the facth "Perrache" is 10 minutes closer to the venue.


### By plane 🛬

The international airport of Lyon-Saint-Exupéry ([LYS](https://www.lyonaeroports.com/en)) is your target. To join the venue, take the airport tramway (~20mn) to join the underground (Metro A). From there, get to the "Cordeliers" station.

### Public transportation 🚋 / by foot 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️

From the rail station **Perrache**, take the underground **Metro A**, direction Vaulx-en-Velin / La Soie, and 4 minutes later get out at the **Cordeliers** station.

From the rail station **Lyon Part-Dieu**, take the bus line **C13** at the bus station outside (Gare Part-Dieu V. Merle). Direction is Gutenberg and get out 11 minutes later at **Cordeliers**. Alternatively, take the underground **B** leading to Charpennes, change for the **A** line leading to Perrache and get out the **Cordeliers** station.

In both cases, you’ll be in front of a big historical monument. You must enter at the rear of the building, at the park (Place de la Bourse).

## Why Lyon ? 💡

- To decentralize the French Web, physically, so that all Web-related events do not take place in Paris. Last year we set camp at Bordeaux, this year it’s Lille. Who knows where we’ll be next year?
- The 2nd biggest city of France has an international aiport, is easy to acesss from nearby country by train.
- People are nice and friendly, and the food is excellent!
