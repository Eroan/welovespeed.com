# Health Protocol

The whole **{{ site.title }}** team is proud to welcome you in the best conditions. To face the specific context resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, we have selected contractors with protocols that respect the current governmental guidelines.

_This page reflects the protocol at a certain time. It is likely to be updated until the event occurs to adapt to the health context. A doubt, a question? Do not hesitate to read the detailed protocols of our contractors._

## Protocol in Effect Since August 2021

A **Health Path** is required to participate in the event: digital, mobile PDF or printed PDF formats are accepted. If you have a vaccination certificate issued out of France but not a French Health Pass, you can [apply for a conversion](https://www.demarches-simplifiees.fr/commencer/passe-sanitaire-etrangers?locale=en).

We ask that you **wear a mask** with a filtration rate of over 90% or a surgical mask when you travel. You can remove it when you enjoy our snacks or meals.

**Hydroalcoholic gel** is available. You must use it when you arrive to wash your hands.

Pre-event registrations will be used to **track** participants in order to inform them of the occurrence of a COVID+ case, if needed.

Information boards are in place, omnipresent and updated to ensure strict compliance with the health best practices (including **social distanciation**) and invite the installation of the "TousAntiCovid" application.
