    Hosting fonts? Good luck!

    In the beginning was The Word.

    Then there was Google Fonts Directory. And the Web was so happy to be able to use an alternative to sans-serif that it turned everything upside down. However, it's already been many years since we understood that using tools like this one doesn't do any good to the Web or to your sites. So the solution is to host your own font files.

    Only... hosting your fonts properly is as complex as hosting your images, videos, or any other static resource. Seemingly as simple as uploading a file to your server, reality can quickly turn into a nightmare when you try to provide the best resource for the context.

    Let's start from what Google Fonts does correctly (providing fonts) and try to understand all the little optimizations that will really boost your forehead! A step-by-step survey and best practices guide, dedicated to the latest neglected area of Web performance: typography.
